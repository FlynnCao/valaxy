注意，这篇文章全是剧透，慎入。因为全都是动辄5、6季的剧集所以会比较长。本次涉及到的美剧有《纸牌屋》、《绝命毒师》。
# 纸牌屋（House of Cards）

## 人物篇

### Frank Underwood

作为全篇的核心人物，可以说在这个角色没有任何事业盲点，也充满了个人魅力。但Frank终其一生也没有真正的朋友和爱人，这就是他最大的缺点。几乎完美的政治机器又何尝不是作为人的悲哀呢。

Frank的人生目标：为政治而生为政治而死，因为他和Claire到最后也没有孩子，也没有任何遗产（有Game of Throne守夜人那感觉），如果硬算，American Works大概算一个。

不管谋杀Zoe Barnes、前Education Bill后迷惑Raymond Tusk来设计陷害Garrett Walker辞职、欺骗Jackie Sharp、利用逼迫谋杀Peter Russo、利用民众恐惧ICO的心理来制造谣言为大选争取时间等等可以说是阴谋诡计无限..但总的来说是整个系统选择了Frank，没什么是非曲直，我们没必要因为game的错误去责怪player。

附一个下议院发言作为角色总结：

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLf4rnJYUGk&ab_channel=AJ%27sMixx


> Will Conway落选这个单纯是因为自己在早期军事行动存在污点（当然自己内心不够强大/无情）导致人设崩塌 -> Will还是有心的，但你的对手Frank可是怪物啊！


PS：遗憾的是在第五季由于演员因为性骚扰风波导致角色被强制下架，给了一个奇怪的结局。

### Claire Underwood 

Underwood夫妇的婚姻是很功利的（是以政治成就为目的，两人更多的是合作关系，但其实是Frank更主导的合作关系），很显然Claire看到了Francis身上的潜力（PLUS：穷小子利用富家女上位是太正常的桥段了）。

因此在前几季Claire的牺牲（或者说），但作为自己获得更高位置交换，她也付出了自己的隐私（大学期间被性侵）和时不时能放松下的爱情。回归他们的婚姻，作为基督徒这些都是很敏感的话题，当然也可以是很好用的旗子。

至于Tom Yates这个关联角色可以说纯粹工具人（为自己的作品献身了），下场要比Adam Galloway只是名声受损惨多了。但Tom Yates也属于“知道的太多“范畴，知道的太多指的不是真正的信息，而是他对于Underwood夫妇心里想法的了解。

其中中，在俄国约旦谷风波和Petrov的故事线也很有意思，作为大使来说工作很出色，巧妙化解了不少危机。其中对于gay的支援但导致美俄协议破灭，可以说是为数不多的人性闪耀时（起码比Frank多多了），当然这是很争议的选择。

Claire的反抗和崛起体现了女权思潮。但就个人看法这部剧反映的美国仍然没有逃出父权框架。


###  Edward Meechum

如果说Douglas是有条件的忠诚的话，Meechum可以说是绝对忠诚了。当然Meechum和Underwood夫妇的关系远比雇佣关系复杂（不记得第几集有暗示threesome）。用一幅图代表Meechum大概就是：


![Edward Meechum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715211957.png)

### Zoe Barnes，Lucas Goodwin, Janine Skorsky, Tom Hammerschmidt

这几个其实是一条时间线。

Zoe Barnes作为肉体交换借位Frank获取信息的记者，纯粹是因为“知道的太多”被杀的。同样的还有Lucas Goodwin，在后期基本上陷入了癫狂状态（也因此触发了刺杀Frank）。Janine Skorsky（像东欧人）和Tom Hammerschmidt（这么长不用想就是德国姓）倒是理性一些的媒体人，也最终报道和揭露了Underwood夫妇大部分的罪行。Tom Hammerschmidt活得最久但也免不了被杀的命运。

实在没什么好说的，这几位是美国的良心。


![Lucas Goodwin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212008.png)

### Doug Stamper

完美的工具人。但看得出来是蛮缺爱的人，这也让他犯了一些关键的错误。Doug的忠诚度令人叹服（包括不惜让自己背锅来威胁医生给Frank换肝源，但其实自己的履历去任何一个反对阵营也能过得很好），但也不是没有手段（比如白宫桌子的窃听器反击Claire和在Heather Dunbar参与2016大选时试图加入敌方阵营迷惑）。

当然，全季最令人摸不着头脑的就是最后一季Doug被Claire亲手杀掉，整篇随着Doug躺在地上荒诞到了极点，那天晚上看到这个结局我感觉无比空虚且愤怒。
（相比看完Breaking Bad的结局我无比充实）

![Game of Throne Meme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212047.png)

不好意思放错图了。

![Ending of House of Cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212128.png)

### Peter Russo

经典浪子回头（让我想到小罗伯特·唐尼）剧本，但在政治斗争中远不如Frank心狠手辣，因为酗酒等崩坏的次数远比Doug多太多，这也导致了自己的失败和死亡。另外Peter被杀后Catherine这条线一直没什么进展很遗憾。不清楚原著如何但感觉Peter也是个被写死的人物。

![Peter Russo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212212.png)


### "Jackie" Sharp,  Remy Danton

比较悲情的两个人物，Remy作为各大主角的工具人被反复利用但确认为自己进不到核心圈子内最后悍然退圈（实际上也是）。Jackie则是被Underfood哄骗利用又威胁，最后还因为种种原因让自己好不容易找到的婚姻也终止（大概是没有正经的恋爱关系过）。

只能说军队出身的多少还是耿直了些，斗不过老油条。（Will的竞选伙伴Ted Brockhart将军也是）


![Jackie and Remy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212229.png)



### Freddy Hayes

作为肋骨烹饪好手的Freddy是明白自己的定位的（和Frank只能算比较熟悉的陌生人），这点也是因为Frank本身就没有正常的朋友关系（只有征服or被征服关系，对Claire也是）。这点在他和自己孙子聊天也能发现"it's OK to dream as long as they aren't fantasies"，只能说这个人是有自己的傲骨的（也包括 Tom Hammerschmidt找他要线索结果遭来一顿胖揍）。

大概全季最悠闲的时光莫过于在白宫花园剪草然后时不时和Frank聊天。

总体来说，这个角色很有意思。


![Freddy BBQ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212256.png)



## 总结

House of Cards充分反映了美国社会的优点和缺点。

当然哪个系统没有利用规则达到自己目的无所不用其极的人呢，但重点是“代价是什么”？

结论已经很明显了。以另一部美剧《chernobyl》的摘抄台词作为结尾吧：


"What is the cost of lies? It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all."

吐槽：如果不狗血好好结尾的话是部不错的剧。但其实直到最后一季还是有弥补的空间的，看得出来剧组是单纯不想拍了就草草结尾，很遗憾。主演 **Kevin Spacey**在Youtube有段很好的演绎，也凸显了他个人的演员实力（很能扯）。这个5分钟视频已经胜过整个第6季了。

# 绝命毒师 (Breaking Bad)

刨去一些纪录片，负责任地讲这已经是imdb上最高分的剧集。绝命毒师讲了一个中年男人逐渐走向巅峰的过程。

## 人物篇

### Walter White


![Walter White](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212331.png)

作为本剧的主角，老白的转变是观众一点点观察来的，并不是什么空穴来风。从最初的失意的中学教师（当然最开头就提到了他有诺贝尔奖的参与）..到因为变故和阴差阳错参与制毒(cook meth)的过程。

老白当然有退的机会。但每一次他都选择了继续，以自己的ego和世界抗争。老白的ego（可以说是自尊心）是他很多时候无法回头的原因，也是他走向巅峰的原因。

其中最重要的一个就是在自己得肺癌拒绝Gretchen夫妇的医疗基金。

![Gretchens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212353.png)

直接导致了老白被迫扩大生意，也让他不得已接近Gus Fring。当然不管是谋杀Gus Fring, Gale还是早期的毒贩Tuco，Pinkman有作祟，但老白的胆子和野心也是越来越大的...而且杀人也越来越熟练。（其中制作轮椅炸弹和雪茄的毒药已经是走向巅峰的表现）

但最后一季仍然有回头的点，在雪屋度过余生或者等烟消云散逃去其他国家也是个不错的选择..直到他看到了电视上对于Gretchen夫妇的采访，种种不甘和怨恨涌上心头.


![Fury](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212415.png)

.复仇..

![Revenge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212451.png)


但永远都回不去了，回不去那个安宁的夜晚，Mr.White和他刚出生的女儿，没起疑心的妻子，关系如铁哥们的父子...幻影破灭后，只剩下老白和他的实验室。

![Ending of Breading Bad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212513.png)


### Jesse Pinkman

这部剧较为荒诞的是最疯的pinkman反而活到了最后，当然这和老白一直无条件愿意拯救他有关系（不管是tuco, gus fring甚至是最后的Jack黑帮）。

当然拯救也免不了一些残酷的选择，比如看着jane死去来唤醒jesse戒毒。（她真的好美！）

![Jane Margolis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212536.png)

对于这个人物本身来说，并没有什么忠诚度和忍耐力（也许这就是所谓的“成不了大事？”），但pinkman有自己的底线。

我会认为pinkman是个正常人，不是天使也不是魔鬼。不管是“no more children”，还是每一次枪口的抉择，pinkman并没有改变，这是他的可贵之处，也是他的可悲之处。

![Jesse Pinkman](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212607.png)

经历过这一切的pinkman会有一个怎样的人生呢。可能至少好过第二季他救过的孩子，他有个正常的童年还有个一直愿意拉他一把的兄弟和忘年交。

### Skyler White

可能是本剧最争议的角色。如果说有人能纠正老白往错误的道路上越走越远，那只能是Skyler。Skyler体现了正常人对于魔鬼的恐惧，但仍然免不了贪婪和背叛（背叛的最多的当然是老白）。

抛去怀孕吸烟这种问题来说，其中最难以原谅的当然是出轨Ted Beneke之后因为自己虚假的正义感不得不卷入Ted的税务问题，把老白用来做家庭建设的半数钱用来给Ted还债，最后TB被摔坏也迁怒于老白..


![Skyler and Ted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212814.png)


当然最蠢的行为应该就是打破了儿子对于父亲的美好想象，直接导致Walter苦心经营的谎言破灭..这将本已经迷途难返的老白判了死刑。

![Truth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212842.png)


至于塑料姐妹花问题，我认为不在讨论的范畴，Marie Schrader作为kleptomania现身也有很多自身的问题，虚荣心等等..



### Mike Ehrmantraut

很好很专业的杀手，很硬汉。

从各方面来讲，这个角色是要优于老白的，至少Mike做杀手却好似是为了家人（连自己孙女都分不到自己的收入，很遗憾），但老白做的很多事只是为了满足自己的pride，或者是自己自作多情的“好”。


“Shut the fuck up Walter, let me die in peace.”

![Mike](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715213005.png)


### Hank Schrader

编剧的巧妙安排让Hank和Walter的案子和行为总是阴差阳错地相互牵连，当然毕竟他们在一座小镇，谁免不了呢。

Hank Schrader是全剧为数不多的好人，不管是铤而走险争取晋升机会满足妻子小小的华盛顿梦还是努力调和两边的家庭矛盾。但很多时候过度追求免不了用力过猛（比如拳击pinkman）这也体现在得知Walter White就是自己日夜追寻的Heisenberg之后的愤怒和决裂。曾经美好的家庭关系瞬间分崩离析：


![Walter Family](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715213037.png)

补充：大战Salamanca两侄子这段可以说是全剧最精彩的打戏（血腥警告）

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kjp3rSU6V0&ab_channel=RottenTomatoesTV


总结：Hank属于“绝对正义”的典型，嫉恶如仇的他是不可能向自己一生抗争的毒贩低头的，R.I.P 

![Death of Hank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715213126.png)


## 总结

Breaking Bad是一部绝佳的禁毒宣传片。不管是癫狂的pinkman, 走向巅峰又走向毁灭的white，无辜的孩子(目睹偷盗现场就被杀的Drew Sharp, 被利用作为枪手又被抛弃的Tomás)，瘾君子的乱象....

但我认为这不剧最棒的一点就是，他维持了人物的正常走向，没有机械降神，没有刻意插入的情节或人物，一切看似自然发生又相互牵连。

愤怒、喜悦、狂暴、镇定、悲怆、信任、背叛、复仇...这是人类的故事。


幸福可以很简单，也可以很复杂。

House of Cards
==============

Character Section
-----------------

### Frank Underwood

As the core character throughout the series, it can be said that this role has no career blind spots and is full of personal charm. However, Frank never had genuine friends or lovers in his life, which is his greatest flaw. His life goal was to live and die for politics, as he and Claire never had children or any inheritance (giving off a feeling similar to the Night's Watch in Game of Thrones). If we were to calculate, American Works is probably his only legacy.

Frank's life was filled with countless conspiracies, such as murdering Zoe Barnes, deceiving Raymond Tusk after the Education Bill, framing Garrett Walker, deceiving Jackie Sharp, manipulating and coercing the murder of Peter Russo, and using public fear of ICO to spread rumors and buy time for the election. Overall, the entire system chose Frank, and there's little sense of right or wrong; we shouldn't blame the player for the game's mistakes.

Attached is a speech from the House of Representatives, which serves as a summary of Frank's character:

[Watch the speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLf4rnJYUGk&ab_channel=AJ%27sMixx)

> Will Conway's failure is simply because he had blemishes from his early military actions (also, he wasn't strong-willed or ruthless enough), which caused his public image to collapse. But remember, Will was not as monstrous as his opponent Frank!

PS: Unfortunately, due to the actor's involvement in a sexual harassment scandal during the fifth season, the character was forcefully written out, leading to a peculiar conclusion.

### Claire Underwood

![Claire Underwood](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715211929.png)

The marriage of the Underwoods is quite pragmatic (aimed at achieving political success, more of a strategic partnership), and it is evident that Claire saw the potential in Francis (plus, the trope of an underprivileged man using a wealthy woman to rise to power is quite common).

In the early seasons, Claire made sacrifices for the sake of gaining higher positions, and she traded her privacy (being sexually assaulted during her college years) and occasionally experiencing moments of love. Regarding their marriage, as Christians, these are sensitive topics that can also serve as potent plot elements.

In the context of the show, Tom Yates is a mere tool (devoted himself to his work), and his fate was much worse than that of Adam Galloway. However, Tom Yates falls under the category of "knowing too much." It's not about possessing actual information, but rather understanding the thoughts of the Underwoods.

Among them, the storylines involving the Jordan Valley crisis and Petrov in Russia are quite interesting. As an ambassador, Claire handles her work exceptionally well, skillfully resolving numerous crises. Her support for the gay community, which led to the failure of the US-Russia agreement, shows a rare glimmer of humanity (at least more than Frank's) and is, of course, a controversial choice.

Claire's rebellion and rise represent the feminist movement. However, from a personal perspective, the show still reflects that the US hasn't completely escaped the patriarchal framework.




### Edward Meechum
![Meechum and Frank](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715211957.png)
If Douglas is a conditionally loyal character, Meechum can be described as absolutely loyal. Of course, Meechum's relationship with the Underwoods is far more complex than a mere employer-employee relationship (there was a hint of a threesome at some point). A single picture could sum up Meechum:

### Zoe Barnes, Lucas Goodwin, Janine Skorsky, Tom Hammerschmidt

These characters share a common timeline.

Zoe Barnes was a journalist who exchanged physical intimacy for information from Frank, and her murder was simply due to "knowing too much." Lucas Goodwin, later in the series, became obsessed and went crazy (which ultimately led to his attempt to assassinate Frank). Janine Skorsky (Eastern European) and Tom Hammerschmidt (with a German-sounding name) were more rational journalists who eventually reported and exposed most of the Underwoods' crimes. Tom Hammerschmidt lived the longest, but he couldn't escape his fate of being killed.

In short, these characters represent the conscience of America.

### Doug Stamper

A perfect tool. It's evident that he is someone who lacks love, leading to critical mistakes. Doug's loyalty is commendable (including threatening a doctor to get a liver for Frank, even though his own credentials could have allowed him to prosper in any opposing camp), but he is not without his methods (e.g., retaliating against Claire with a bug on the White House table and trying to deceive Heather Dunbar when she joined the 2016 election).

Of course, the most mind-boggling aspect of the entire series is Doug's death at the hands of Claire in the last season. The scene of Doug lying on the ground is absurd, and that ending left me feeling empty and angry (much different from the fulfilling ending of Breaking Bad).

Apologies for the mix-up.

### Peter Russo

A classic prodigal son storyline (reminds me of Robert Downey Jr.). However, Peter lacks the ruthlessness in political struggle that Frank possesses. His multiple relapses into alcoholism led to his downfall and death. The storyline involving Catherine after Peter's death had little progression, which is regrettable. It's unclear how the original work handled this character, but it seems Peter was destined to meet a tragic end.

### "Jackie" Sharp, Remy Danton

These two characters have a more tragic storyline. Remy, as a pawn of major players, is repeatedly used but ultimately realizes that he can never penetrate the inner circle. Jackie, on the other hand, is deceived and manipulated by Underwood and is ultimately threatened. Her marriage, which she worked hard to find, is also terminated for various reasons (probably because she has never had a genuine love relationship).

It's safe to say that their military backgrounds make them more straightforward, but they can't compete with the cunning players (similar to Ted Brockhart, Will's campaign partner).

### Freddy Hayes

Freddy, the skilled rib cook, is aware of his place (a familiar stranger to Frank). This is partly because Frank never had normal friendships (only relationships based on domination or being dominated, including with Claire). This aspect is evident when he speaks with his grandson, "It's OK to dream as long as they aren't fantasies." He is a person with his own pride (as shown when he beats up Tom Hammerschmidt after he comes to ask for information).

Overall, this character is quite interesting.

Summary
-------

House of Cards fully reflects the strengths and weaknesses of American society.

Of course, what system doesn't have people using rules to achieve their goals through any means possible? But the critical question is, "What is the cost?"

The conclusion is clear. Quoting a line from another American series, "Chernobyl":

"What is the cost of lies? It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies, then we no longer recognize the truth at all."

Satire: If the ending was less absurd, it would have been an excellent show. However, it seems the creators just wanted to finish it without much thought, which is regrettable. Kevin Spacey, the main actor, has a fantastic performance on YouTube, showcasing his acting talent (he can be very persuasive). This 5-minute video surpasses the entire sixth season.

Breaking Bad
============

Excluding some documentaries, this is the highest-rated TV show on IMDb. Breaking Bad tells the story of a middle-aged man's journey to the top.

Character Section
-----------------


### Walter White
![Walter White](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212331.png)

As the main character of the show, Walter White's transformation is gradually observed by the audience and not some sudden occurrence. He started as a disgruntled high school teacher (of course, it's mentioned early on that he was involved in a Nobel Prize), and he gradually got involved in drug production (cooking meth) due to unforeseen circumstances and coincidences.

Walter always had opportunities to back down, but each time, he chose to continue, driven by his ego and his struggle against the world. Walter's ego (or pride) is one of the reasons he couldn't turn back at many points in his journey, and it's also what led him to reach the pinnacle.

One crucial moment was when he refused Gretchen and Elliott's medical funds for his cancer treatment.

This event forced Walter to expand his business and eventually led him to get involved with Gus Fring. Regardless of killing Gus Fring, Gale, or his early drug dealer, Tuco, Jesse Pinkman played a role, but Walter's courage and ambition only grew stronger, and he became more proficient at killing (such as making a wheelchair bomb and poison in cigars).

But in the final season, there was still a turning point. In the cabin in the snow, he could have lived the rest of his life there or escaped to another country. But then he saw the interview with Gretchen and Elliott on TV, which fueled his frustration and resentment.

After that, revenge...

But there was no turning back. Walter could no longer return to the peaceful nights, being Mr. White with his newborn daughter, his unsuspecting wife, and the father-son relationship with Pinkman... The illusions shattered, leaving only Walter and his laboratory.

### Jesse Pinkman

![Jesse Pinkman](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212607.png)

One of the most surreal aspects of the show is that the craziest character, Pinkman, lived until the end. Of course, this is due to Walter's constant willingness to save him unconditionally (whether it's Tuco, Gus Fring, or finally the neo-Nazis).

Saving him also involved making some ruthless choices, such as allowing Jane to die to awaken Jesse from drug addiction. She was so beautiful!

For this character, Jesse is not a good person or a bad person. He's just a regular person, neither an angel nor a demon. Whether it's "no more children" or every trigger of a gun, Jesse hasn't changed, and that's what makes him admirable and tragic.

What kind of life awaits Jesse after experiencing all of this? It's probably better than the kid he saved in the second season, with a normal childhood and a caring brother and father-figure willing to lend him a hand whenever he needs it.

> If you can't use YouTube: [Watch on Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LS4y147Wz/)

### Skyler White

Possibly the most controversial character in the show. If there was anyone who could have corrected Walter from veering further down the wrong path, it would have been Skyler. She personifies the fear of ordinary people towards a demon, but she couldn't avoid greed and betrayal (most notably, betraying Walter).

Setting aside issues like smoking while pregnant, the most unforgivable actions were her affair with Ted Beneke, leading to her involvement in his tax problems due to her false sense of justice, using half of the money Walter earned for their family to pay off Ted's debts, and eventually blaming Walter for breaking the television after TB's death...

The most foolish act of all was breaking her son's perception of his father, leading to the collapse of the lies that Walter had carefully constructed. This sentencing Walter to death.

![Skyler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlynnCao/blog-images/main/img/20230715212842.png)

Regarding the issues of the toxic friends, I believe that they are not within the scope of this discussion. Marie Schrader, with her kleptomania, has many personal issues, such as vanity, etc.

### Mike Ehrmantraut

A very professional hitman, a real tough guy.

In many ways, this character is superior to Walter. At least, Mike is a hitman seemingly working for his family's well-being (he doesn't even leave a portion of his earnings for his granddaughter, which is a shame). On the other hand, Walter did many things just to satisfy his pride or his misguided idea of being "good."

"Shut the fuck up Walter, let me die in peace."

### Hank Schrader

The clever writing of the show always intertwined Hank and Walter's cases and actions through coincidence, but this is understandable as they live in a small town.

Hank Schrader is one of the few good people in the show, whether it's taking risks to secure a promotion and fulfill his wife's small Washington dream or working hard to reconcile family conflicts. But sometimes his pursuit of justice becomes excessive, as seen when he punches Pinkman in the face, and it leads to his anger and estrangement after learning that Walter White is the elusive Heisenberg. The once lovely family relationship shattered...

In conclusion, Hank represents the epitome of "absolute justice." He would never bow to the drug dealer he had been chasing his whole life. R.I.P.

### Summary

Breaking Bad is an excellent anti-drug campaign. Whether it's the crazy Pinkman, the rise and fall of White, the innocent children (like Drew Sharp, who was killed just for witnessing a robbery), or the chaos caused by drug addicts, the show portrays it all.

What makes it the best is that it maintains the normal progression of the characters, without any forced, artificial plotlines or characters. Everything seems natural and interconnected.

Anger, joy, violence, calm, sadness, trust, betrayal, revenge... This is the story of humanity.

Happiness can be simple, but it can also be complex.
